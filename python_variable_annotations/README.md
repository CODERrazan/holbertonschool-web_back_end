# Python Type Annotations Project

A collection of exercises to master Python type hints and static type checking.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- All files executable with proper shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- `pycodestyle` compliant (v2.5)
- Complete docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- Type annotations for all relevant code
- Validation with `mypy`

## Tasks
1. Basic variable annotations
2. Function signatures with types
3. Working with floats and integers
4. String operations with type hints
5. Complex type patterns:
   - Lists of floats
   - Mixed-type lists
   - Tuple conversions
6. Typed functions
7. Duck typing implementations
